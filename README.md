# media-simulation

# Description

* This project is a simulation of a shared media service model. The simulation follows a model where a company holds several accounts to five different media streaming services (Netflix, Prime video, CraveTv, Disney+, and Paramount+). The company shares these accounts among a group of customers who pay the company the average price that one of the afformentioned streaming services charge for an account.
* The goal of the company that the simulation is based on is to provide a much wider catalog of media, providing all media from all streaming services mentioned above. And to provide this greater catalog at a better price. This would be achieved by owning a large number of accounts in each service and time-sharing these accounts among a larger customer base.
* The goal of the simulation model that this repository contains is to find an appropriate number of accounts for each streaming service as well as the company service price, in order to ensure that customers do not experience any waiting time (or exerience very minimal and rare waiting time) and that the company generates a profit.

# Dependencies

* The program does not have any dependancies, only standard c and c++ libraries are used.

# How to run the program
